# PaymentAssistant

This is a project that I made for something and it seems that it won't be used for that something, so i decided to make it open source.

**Note:** Personally, I don't think this code is well made (specially the frontend) but you're free to use and contribute to it.

## Description 

It's a simple Python Flask application for a fee payment system. Was going to serve as an automation for some university that still does not use modern technology, but as it seems, they *will* keep going with old stuff.

Others libraries used here are in [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt). The frontend only uses Bootstrap and some other JS libs like aos.js.

The main language of the page is spanish.

## Installation

Just clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Vz0n/PaymentAssistant`, instal dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `python run.py`.
